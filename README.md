# Restaurant Management System â€” Reservations and Delivery

## Project Overview

This comprehensive web-based system is designed to streamline restaurant operations by providing an integrated solution for managing table reservations and delivery orders. The system addresses common challenges faced by restaurants that rely on traditional methods such as phone calls and social media for order management.

### Problem Statement

Many restaurants struggle with:
- Confusion and conflicts in reservation scheduling
- Loss of important order information during busy periods
- Delays in customer service response
- Difficulty tracking restaurant occupancy and delivery sales
- Inefficient communication between customers and restaurant staff
- Manual processes that lead to human error and operational inefficiencies

### Solution

Our system provides a digital transformation through three integrated components:

1. **Customer-Facing Chatbot**: Enables users to make reservations, browse menus, place delivery orders, and request information through natural conversation
2. **Administrative Dashboard**: Provides restaurant staff with comprehensive tools to manage all operations from a centralized interface
3. **Backend API with Database**: Ensures data integrity, security, and seamless communication between all system components
